# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build and Test Commands

- Build: `pnpm build`
- Lint: `pnpm lint`
- Type check: `pnpm typecheck`
- Test all: `pnpm test`
- Test single file: `pnpm vitest <path/to/file.unit.test.ts>`
- Run only specific tests: `pnpm test "test name pattern"`

Note: Make sure to run the commands in the sub-packages if only modifying files in that package. (to make it easier run `pnpm lint --fix` in the subpackage to fix linting errors)

## Code Style Guidelines

- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Unit tests use `.unit.test.ts` suffix, integration tests use `.int.test.ts`
- Node 16 module resolution - include file extensions in imports (`.js`)
- Always import vitest globals explicitly (describe, it, expect)
- Sort imports by group: external libs first, then local imports
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types/classes
- Always include return types on top-level functions including React components (`React.ReactElement`)
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Colocate tests with implementation files
- Include absolute paths in import statements via tsconfig paths (`@src/` is the alias for `src/`)
- Order functions such that functions are placed below the variables/functions they use
- Use kebab-case for file names
- If a particular interface or type is not exported, change the file so it is exported

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Clear Test Names**: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, execution, and verification phases
3. **Mock External Services**: Always mock external API calls and file system operations
4. **Use Test Helpers**: Extract common setup code into test helpers
5. **Test Error Cases**: Include tests for error conditions and edge cases
6. **Avoid Test Interdependence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
7. **Clean Up After Tests**: Always reset mocks and clean up resources in afterEach
8. **Use Type-Safe Mocks**: Leverage TypeScript for type-safe mocking
9. **Test Public APIs**: Focus on testing public methods and behaviors, not implementation details
10. **Keep Tests Simple**: Each test should verify one specific behavior

### Test Organization

- Unit tests are colocated with source files using `.unit.test.ts` suffix
- Integration tests use `.int.test.ts` suffix
- Test helpers are located in `src/tests/` directory
- Manual mocks are in `src/__mocks__/` directory

### Common Test Patterns

#### Mocking the File System

For file system operations, use memfs:

```typescript
import { vol } from 'memfs';

vi.mock('node:fs');
vi.mock('node:fs/promises');

beforeEach(() => {
  vol.reset();
});

afterEach(() => {
  vol.reset();
});
```

## Repository Structure

Baseplate is organized into several core packages:

### Project Builder

- **packages/project-builder-cli**: CLI application that starts the server and web interface
- **packages/project-builder-web**: React app for configuring project definitions
- **packages/project-builder-server**: Fastify-based backend API for the web interface using TRPC
- **packages/project-builder-lib**: Shared library with common logic and schema definitions
- **packages/project-builder-common**: Common types and utilities shared across builder packages
- **packages/project-builder-test**: Test runner and utilities for integration testing
- **packages/create-project**: CLI tool for bootstrapping new Baseplate projects
- **packages/ui-components**: Reusable UI component library with Storybook

### Sync Engine

- **packages/sync**: Core package orchestrating code generation workflow
- **packages/core-generators**: Generates TypeScript code and base abstractions
- **packages/react-generators**: Generates React components and structure
- **packages/fastify-generators**: Generates Fastify-based backend code

### Utilities

- **packages/code-morph**: Tools for codebase transformations
- **packages/tools**: Common configurations (ESLint, Prettier, TSConfig, Vitest)
- **packages/utils**: Utility functions

### Plugins

- **plugins/baseplate-plugin-auth**: Authentication plugin (includes auth0 and local auth implementations)
- **plugins/baseplate-plugin-storage**: Storage plugin (S3 and local file storage)

## Architecture Overview

Baseplate consists of two main tiers:

1. **Project Builder**: UI-driven configuration tool that produces a project definition (JSON)

   - Allows configuring data models, authentication, etc.
   - Compiles high-level definitions into generator bundles

2. **Sync Engine**: Code generation system that processes generator bundles
   - Executes generators in dependency order
   - Handles Task Phases for multi-stage code generation
   - Manages Dynamic Tasks for data-driven generation
   - Uses Provider Scopes for communication between tasks
   - Merges generated code with existing codebase using Git Diff3

## Key Concepts

### Generators

- Created with `createGenerator`
- Define configuration via descriptor schema (Zod)
- Consist of one or more tasks

### Tasks

- Created with `createGeneratorTask`
- Have `run` (initialization) and `build` (code generation) phases
- Export and consume providers
- May be organized into phases for ordered execution

### Providers

- Enable communication between tasks
- Standard providers (mutable state) vs. Output providers (read-only)
- Use scopes to control visibility and prevent collisions

### TypeScript Code Generation

- `TsCodeFragment` for composable code pieces
- `TsCodeUtils` for manipulating fragments
- Import builder for managing dependencies
- Template system for code generation

## Plugin System

- Extends Baseplate with custom features, generators, and UI components
- Uses spec-implementation pattern for loose coupling
- Supports multi-platform modules (node, web, common)

## Code Structure Patterns

- Follow task-based architecture for generators
- Use provider scopes for explicit wiring
- Leverage TypeScript rendering system for code generation
- Organize complex generation with Task Phases
- Use Dynamic Tasks for data-driven generation

## Key Reminders for Claude Code

- Always use `.js` extensions in imports, even for TypeScript files
- Specify explicit return types on all functions
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Import test functions from 'vitest' (no globals)
- Collocate tests with source files using `.unit.test.ts` or `.int.test.ts` suffixes
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` before committing changes
- If a particular interface or type is not exported, change the file so it is exported
- Keep tests simple and focused and try to extract repeated logic into helper functions
- Apply a reasonable number of tests
- If you are adding a new feature, please also add a new Changeset for it in the `.changeset/` directory of the form (keeping things to patch changes for now):

  ```markdown
  ---
  'package-name': patch
  ---

  Description of the feature or change
  ```

- IMPORTANT: If you have to go through more than one cycle of edits to fix linting, type, or test errors, please stop and ask for help. Often fixing errors will cause worse changes so it's better to ask for help than to continue. Feel free to ask for help at any time for any issues.

## Baseplate Docs MCP

Please interact with the baseplate-docs MCP to get the most up to date information on the project. Here are the following tips:

Docs specific:

- Creating Design Docs: Search for the document by id "e84a9e72-9980-41f6-bdda-296736c5ff69" for the design doc template
- Please add a description when creating documents to describe the document and its purpose.
- Please use Mermaid documents instead of ASCII art diagrams.

Collection keys:

- **baseplate-docs**: Baseplate documentation
- **design-docs**: Design documentation

Document Retrieval

- get-document - Retrieve full document content by URI (format:
  documents://collection-name/path/to/doc.md)
- get-document-by-id - Retrieve document by its Outline ID
- list-documents - List documents with optional filters:
  - collectionKey - Filter by specific collection
  - prefix - Filter by subdirectory path
  - keywords - Space-separated keywords (ALL must match)

Search Tools

- search-documents - Semantic search returning full documents with
  similarity scores
- search-rag-documents - RAG search returning specific document
  chunks/passages with location info

Collection Management

- list-collections - List all available collections

Document Editing (if enabled)

- edit-document - Replace entire document content
