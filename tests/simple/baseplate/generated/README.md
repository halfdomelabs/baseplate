# simple

A full-stack application generated by Baseplate.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo project using pnpm workspaces. Applications are organized in the `apps/` directory.

For detailed setup instructions and documentation specific to each application, please refer to their respective README files in `apps/*/README.md`.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 22+
- **pnpm**: Version 10+ ([installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation))
- Additional prerequisites may be required depending on your project configuration (database, etc.). See individual app READMEs for details.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Start Infrastructure Services

Start Docker services (database, cache, etc.):

```bash
cd docker && docker compose up
```

This starts all required infrastructure services like PostgreSQL and Redis (if enabled).

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Each application may require its own environment configuration. See the individual app READMEs in `apps/*/README.md` for specific setup instructions.

### 4. Additional Setup

Some applications may require additional setup steps (database migrations, seeding, etc.). Refer to the individual app READMEs for details.

### 5. Start Development Servers

From the root directory:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start all applications concurrently.

## Common Commands

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
# Infrastructure
cd docker && docker compose up    # Start infrastructure services (database, etc.)
cd docker && docker compose down  # Stop infrastructure services

# Development
pnpm dev              # Start all apps in development mode

# Building
pnpm build            # Build all packages

# Code Quality
pnpm lint             # Lint all packages
pnpm lint -- --fix    # Lint and auto-fix issues
pnpm typecheck        # Type check all packages
pnpm test             # Run tests across all packages

# Formatting
pnpm prettier:check   # Check code formatting
pnpm prettier:write   # Format code
```

## Architecture

This project follows Baseplate's generated architecture:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with strict checking across all applications
- **Modular Design**: Feature-based organization with clear separation of concerns
- **Modern Stack**: Built with industry-standard tools and frameworks
