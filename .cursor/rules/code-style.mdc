- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Unit tests use `.unit.test.ts` suffix, integration tests use `.int.test.ts`
- Node 16 module resolution - include file extensions in imports (`.js`)
- Always import vitest globals explicitly (describe, it, expect)
- Sort imports by group: external libs first, then local imports
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types/classes
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Colocate tests with implementation files
- Include absolute paths in import statements via tsconfig paths
