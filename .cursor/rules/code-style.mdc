- Use TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
- All functions (excluding one-liner arrow functions) require explicit return types

## File Naming & Organization
- Unit tests use `.unit.test.ts` suffix
- Integration tests use `.int.test.ts` suffix
- Colocate tests with implementation files

## Testing Practices
- Always import vitest globals explicitly (describe, it, expect)

## Import Management
- Sort imports by group:
  1. External libraries first
  2. Local imports second
- Include absolute paths in import statements using @src/* when it results in shorter imports

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for types and classes

## Code Style
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Extract repeated components into distinct functions or components where applicable
