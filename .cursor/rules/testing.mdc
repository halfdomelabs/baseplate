## Testing Best Practices

1. **Clear Test Names**: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear setup, execution, and verification phases
3. **Mock External Services**: Always mock external API calls and file system operations
4. **Use Test Helpers**: Extract common setup code into test helpers. These can be new files if needed named `*.test-helper.ts`.
5. **Avoid Test Interdependence**: Each test should be independent and not rely on others
6. **
7. **Use Type-Safe Mocks**: Leverage TypeScript for type-safe mocking
8. **Test Public APIs**: Focus on testing public methods and behaviors, not implementation details
9. **Keep Tests Simple**: Each test should verify one specific behavior
10. **Reusable functions**: Extract repeated logic into helper functions
11. **Judicious tests**: Try to test broad behavior and common edge cases but be intelligent in the number of tests introduced to avoid slowing down CI.
12. **Refactor for testability**: If the target code is not easily testable, feel free to refactor the code to be more easily testable, e.g. exporting types or functions.

### Test Organization

- Unit tests are colocated with source files using `.unit.test.ts` suffix
- Integration tests use `.int.test.ts` suffix
- Test helpers are located in `src/tests/` directory
- Manual mocks are in `src/__mocks__/` directory

### Common Test Patterns

#### Mocking the File System

For file system operations, use memfs:

```typescript
import { vol } from 'memfs';

vi.mock('node:fs');
vi.mock('node:fs/promises');

beforeEach(() => {
  vol.reset();
});

test('should do something', () => {
  // Arrange
  vol.fromJSON({
    'test-file.txt': 'test content',
  })

  // Act
  ...

  // Assert
  const files = vol.toJSON();
  expect(files['test-file.txt']).toBe('test content');
});
```

If using globby, make sure we pass the mocked fs adapter:

```typescript
import { globby } from 'globby';
import fsAdapter from 'node:fs';

const files = await globby(['**/*.ts'], { fs: fsAdapter });
```
